# universal-booru-scraper

A small scraper written in Typescript and NodeJS supporting some popular Booru software

## Supports
- Gelbooru
- Danbooru
- Moebooru (**No scraper written yet, but the provider exists!**)
- Yande.re

However, feel free to contribute more, or fixes for the existing providers!


## Using

It's pretty simple to use, simply invoke `pnpm start:<name of booru provider in lowercase>` (eg, `pnpm start:gelbooru`), and you'll be given an interactive prompt to enter what tag you want to scrape, and given the option to add more tags.

### If you have any issues, please report them! This software is a huge WIP.
